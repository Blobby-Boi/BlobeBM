 <h1>Welcome to BlobeBM!</h1> BlobeBM is an HTML program that runs bookmarklets in about:blank. It's very useful if bookmarklets don't work on your device or if they are blocked by your administrator. While the purpose of bookmarklets is lost in BlobeBM, (that is, being able to run code in any website) some bookmarklets are still useful and fun to mess with!
  <h3>Please allow popups on this page to launch BlobeBM.</h3> A better version of BlobeBM that can run code on any page <a href="https://blobby-boi.github.io/uBlobeBM/">can be found here!</a>
